With Android though, even if we assume that most of the apps in the FAMILY category are games, combining that with the actual GAMES category only results in a little less than 29%. That suggests that Android has a more diverse set of applications. Within both environments many of the applications are games, but it is uncertain if they are the most popular among users."

On the other hand, in the ```Social Media``` environment there are a few apps that are easily recognizable (like Facebook and Pinterest), but there are many more with less of the market share. This could be a space that allows for some competition among less popular providers. The same is true with ```Music``` apps. One avenue to look at is building an app that targets a specific group, like a social media conector for people with the same hobby or sports interests or a music app affiliated with a particular label or group. In the ```Weather``` category there a few more very popular applications, but the less popular ones represent only a small number of downloads."

    "* The most popular app genres are over-represented by a few very popular applications. For example, the iOS ```Navigation``` category consists almost entireley of two apps. This is also true for Android, but may be less important. The total number of Android downloads per genre (tens of millions with Android as opposed to tens of thousands with iOS) still leaves ample room for development. Aditionally, all the groupings in the Google arena appear to be less shifted.\n",
    "* With both environments micro-targeting or developing for a smaller niche group could still result in a product that reaches a lot of customers. An application that was associated with a unique style of music (i.e. cumbia, samba, or regional folk music) or a specific hobby (knitting, kite-boarding) could be globally popular or maintain a steady user base."
